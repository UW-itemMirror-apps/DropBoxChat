# DropBox Chat client

This Single Page web application lets you chat by using your dropbox login. It has been developed using the Socket.io module and DropBox API.


# How it works

Launch the application. The page will ask for your DropBox login. It is needed to authenticate you as a valid DropBox user. After Successful authentication, a chat window will appear which will have other dropbox users who are available for chat.


# Targeted Users

Anybody with a DropBox account, and wants the ability to chat with Other DropBox users.

# Why will people use it

Through this application, we intend to combine the privcay features of DropBox with a new chat feature. Through your DropBox account, you can use our application to chat with other DropBox users only. This way your chat will be kept private in the confines of DropBox. In future iterations, we intend to add the ability to create chat rooms based on your chat folders.
